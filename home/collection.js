The clouds rain down,
and I am parted from my love.
On a day like today, how can I part
my heart from my heart’s love?

The clouds and the rain and
I and my love waiting to say farewell:
For my part, weeping,
and for the cloud’s part,
and for my love’s.

The new sprouts,
the joyous air,
the garden bright green,
and the black-faced nightingale
parted from the roses.

Ah me, shackled to your every strand of hair.
What are you doing, pulling me
apart limb from limb?

My eyes rain down tears
for you, the pupil of my eyes. Stand strong.
Don’t depart on this flood of tears.

I will no longer need the gift of sight
after my eyes are parted
from the gift of the sight of you.

Cracks breach my eyes weeping for you.
Quick, take clay from your path
and patch the parting cracks in the wall.

Don’t depart.
I will give you my soul.
If you don’t believe me,
if you want more,
take and keep it.

Your beauty won’t last long when you leave Khusrau.
The rose doesn’t last long parted from the thorn.`}, 

{text: ` basī shab bā mahī būdam kujā shud ān hama shabhā
Many nights I was with a moon.
Where are all those nights gone?
It’s night again now, dark
with the smoke of my cries.

Happy nights I spent with her,
giddy at times or drunk.
When I recall those nights,
my world goes black.

I used to rehearse the tale
of her eyelashes and brows
over and again like children
reciting the Qur’ān at school.

What might happen one night
if she asks how a stranger
below her wall passes
the night these lonely nights?

You are the meaning behind every form.
Come, let lovers—
forms without meaning—
live again in your street.

Though you robbed me of heart
and soul, look at me and see
how finely that smile came
from those lips into these eyes.

Don’t grieve for your life
though the friend slays you, Khusrau.
The beautiful have many sects
that act this way.`}, 

{text: ` dīvāna mīkunī dil-u jān-i kharāb-rā
You drive my ruined heart and soul insane.
Don’t twirl your hair in sport
and break those chains of pure musk.

Though it’s a sin to shed innocent
blood, come shed my blood
and earn holy blessings.

Don’t waste rose water on beggars’ robes:
this age does not deserve
the perfume of love’s union.

Love, how did you come to work
on a nobody like me? Is no one else
left in this ruined world?

Not having dreamt bitter dreams
a single night, how can they know
the taste of aching absence?

The times suffer a drought of faithfulness
and storms well up in the eyes:
When will the stars decree this omen of rain?

We are slaves to a glance always
ready to parry. As soon as I said, Kill!
he brandished his eyelash sword.

If he’s happy killing the helpless,
let straightforwardness,
Lord, speed his arrow’s flight.

In vain is the devastating
beauty of ephebe and sāqī.
As an intoxicant wine is falsely accused.

From heart’s fire my sobbing
lets fall tears of blood:
The roast sobs sweetly over the flame.

Khusrau cannot staunch his burning tears.
Yes, the hot kettle brings water to a boil.`}, 

{text: ` tā bar sar-i bāzār bi-mastī qadamash raft
As he reeled drunkenly through the bazaar,
everything people had amassed got swept
away on the winds of his tyranny,
and whatever patience or composure
my burning heart once had was lost
in the spiralling curls of his swirling hair.

When Joseph passed through the market
of beauty, his entire capital
went for seventeen gold coins, but
the precious life I sqaundered suffering
for my love could not buy a single day
of joyous togetherness.

The skirts of his blandishment were never
stained by the blood of the dear ones
he trampled underfoot. Many have lost
their lives to the sword of punishment;
how happy the head
that goes under the blade of his largesse!

The writ of destiny went thus:
The soul will be lost in love.
And in short, it went as it was writ.

As my soul watched how his regal phantom
wreaked slaughter, it picked up its shroud
and marched under his banner with its sword.

Remembering him tonight Khusrau’s night
lingered long and grew no shorter
though a moon rose large and sank.`}, 

{text: ` gul imshab ākhir-i shab mast bar khāst
Drunk tonight the rose arose near dawn
and bedecked the banquet with a goblet tulip-red.

Over here the grass sat rooted to the spot.
The cypress stood attentive there on the right.
The breeze was blowing,
and the drowsy narcissus
went stumbling up and down all over.

In the garden, I was lying with a friend,
by God, like a moon without wax or wane.
A cry rose from my heart without my wanting
when she wanted to get up from Khusrau’s side.`}, 

{text: ` man u shab zindagānī-yi man in ast
The night and I—this is my life.
Sorrow and the heart—this is my joy.

I drink heart’s blood all night
in her memory. This is my pale pink wine.

At night I bewail the insomnia
of absence. This is my cordial song.

I and dark nights in grief’s corner—
this is where I secretly rejoice.

Her phantom closes my eyes to myself,
for this is my soulmate at night.

She shouldn’t be distressed by my distress.
This is just what I suspected from my heart.

Sometimes I die for her love, sometimes
I live again—this is how my life goes.

Permit me to die at your feet,
for this is my eternal life.

Khusrau costs you no more than to say,
‘This is the slave I got for free.’`}, 

{text: ` asarī namānd bāqī az man andar ārzūyat
Yearning for you, no trace of me remains.
What shall I do, for no one gets his fill
of gazing upon your beautiful cheek.
All day in your street, all night at your door,
I have no goal but to look at your face.
I will now circumambulate your street
with just my eyes, for my legs are worn down
to the knees in searching for you.

By faith, will you accept that tracking down
your fidelity, I fed my blood-soaked
heart to the dogs on your street? My mind,
my reason, my senses, heart and eyes too
are devoid of any image but the image
of your face. No, I cannot rightly render
service to you short of yielding
my sweet life in yearning for you.

Which garden do you come from that your scent
is so sweet, my Rose? Your breeze enlarges
the soul, and the dead heart is brought to life.
Though you load my body, weak as a hair,
with a universe of woe, I’ll not trade
a single strand of your hair for both worlds.
What need to explain to you how I am,
now that Khusrau has become a legend
in yearning and searching for you?`}, 

{text: ` muflisī az pādshā’ī khushtar ast
Poverty is more pleasant than majesty;
depravity, more pleasant than piety.
Majesty has its headaches, and when
last I looked, beggary was more pleasant.
Since kings let no one approach them,
being indigent among the poor
is more pleasant.

When pride gets into someone’s head,
being pals with a dog from the streets
is more pleasant.

When the heart breaks with melancholy
over some beauty, that breaking is more pleasant
than any salve. Public love play with idols
is more pleasant than all this devout hypocrisy.
Once won, there’s no pleasure in love.
Separation, for those who play this game,
is more pleasant.

Put your base love out of your mind,
Khusrau. Love for the sacred secret
is more pleasant.`}, 

{text: ` bīdār shaw dilā ki jahān jā-yi khvāb nīst
Wake up, my heart! This world’s no place to sleep.
Among these ruins, it’s not proper to sit
safe and secure.
Why ask the drowsy sleepers what it’s like,
that sweet sleep for which there is no answer?
In the grave, no friend feigns faithfulness.
Only in the ruins beneath the dust
can the weary dwell content.

Since the drunk do not know time’s tyrannies,
nothing’s better for the sober than wine
and a simple meal.
It’s wrong to ask life’s savour from heaven,
a piddling cup that holds no proper hope.
Sāqī, send round to Khusrau a drop
from the goblet of love,
for there is no headier wine than that.`}, 

{text: ` mast-i turā bi-hīch may-ī ihtiyāj nīst
One drunk on you needs
no wine. No doctor
has the cure for my pain.

Moon, don’t rise before my eyes,
for with his face
I have no need for you at all.

Don’t tell me tales of Jamshī’s crown.
The dust at the door of the Magian temple
is no less than a diadem.

How long will you petition the friend
with your needs? He is aware.
There’s no need for such impertinence.

The coin of the heart not stamped
with unity is counterfeit
with no currency in any land.

The kingdom of the heart was plundered
by the beauties’ tyranny. Be gone, heart,
for there’s no tax on ruined villages.

Khusrau, none of the insightful have seen
your like among people, which is nothing
but an attribute of their squinting eyes.`}, 

{text: ` gar bāgh pur shukūfa vu gulzar khurram ast
What does it profit if roses rejoice
and the garden is in full bloom?
Our heart is sorrow-bound.
Like the breeze at dawn
we rustled through the world and found
that joyful hearts are scarce
in this realm of living sadness.
Torrents of grief are the only rain
to fall from the hard, azure sky.
How miserable to dwell
beneath this turquoise dome.

Wherever he lives around the world,
heart’s blood is the only wine
a poor man drinks.
People regard the ethical with low contempt
while the ignorant see themselves
as the ultimate in rectitude.
How can one look to heaven for joy
when it too wanders bewildered, clad
in funereal indigo?
The spawn of the age
show loyalty to no man.
Pity anyone who’s not part of the crowd.

A cup of dregs
from the bottom of the barrel
is in truth more pleasant
than a goblet drunk
in the palace of kings.
Go, Khusrau,
and find a corner
of contentment in which to dwell.
Drink wine, and never turn
from a friend
in whom you can trust.`}, 

{text: ` khum tuhī gasht u hanūz-am jān az may sīrāb nīst
The vat is empty,
and my heart is still not sated with wine.
If finer vintages are exhausted,
O heart of mine,
your blood has been kept in reserve.
The clanking of Majnūn’s chains is organ
music for lovers, a music
the prudent don’t have the ear to taste.

Wheeling fates,
don’t bother. I have enemies
enough to love me: no need for the butcher
where the executioner stands ready.
Tell the king, ‘Make his blood run!’
Tell the authorities, ‘Off with his head!’
To abandon the beloved for the sake
of one’s life is no part of the lovers’ creed.

Look out.
If you have any sense, beware!
Take no pity on me: madness
is the best thing to pack for this path.
If the beloved’s beauty is not in sight,
its phantom can still make me happy.
In poor homes, moonlight makes the best candle.

Homicidal hunter!
Infidel!
Be gentle a while.
The helpless gazelle cannot contend
with barbarian arrows. Why does that heart,
no longer mine,
circle around you so? Are no
impatient arrows left in your quiver?
Sometimes in my dreams, you said
you would show me your face.
Tell it to a stranger.
One who knows you never sleeps.

Heart,
you will die thirsty.
Turn away from that dimple.
If you dig any deeper in that well,
blood will come to the surface:
No water to be had there.

Khusrau,
first tie on the infidel’s sash,
then bow down in adoration.
That eyebrow is a temple for idols:
No prayer niche to be found there.`}, 

{text: ` marā bāz az tarīq-i sāqī-yi khud yād mīāyad
When my sāqī brings the cup, it stirs up
memories again, and again old sorrows
visit my joyless heart. Misfortune comes
on one side to offer congratulations,
and on the other his absence looms,
sword poised to kill: Burn,
wounded lover! He comes cold and
loveless. Poor nightingale, wail!
The hunter is on his way.

Before him, I can’t choke back my sad moans:
the dog starts howling when it sees a thief.

Sleep, be gone! You’re no friend of mine tonight
as I remember that someone’s tangled hair.
The wind wracks me with his scent:
stop it for once there on the porch
and board up the window when it blows
from that direction. When he’s absent,
his scent wafts from wild marjoram
and won’t let me forget how his hair curls.

He left and reduced me to ruins. Muslims, help!
Spiteful he saps my foundations again.

I love you so much
I am overcome with jealousy
if you treat someone else
as badly as you treated me.

Don’t listen, my dear. The legend of Khusrau
will sear your heart, for it carries
the scent of Farhād’s anguished heart.`}, 

{text: ` chi khush subhī damīd imshab az rū-yi yār-i khud
What a fine dawn broke tonight
from my lover’s face! This early spring
refreshed the garden of my life.
Praise God! Fortune’s field bore fruit,
and nothing my eyes rained down
upon my days has gone to waste.

Was separation the Judgement Day?
So it seems to me. When it came to an end,
I saw the door of paradise open
upon her exquisite face, and now
that I know nothing of my countless pains,
I can give my friends no account
of my one-time sorrows. My heart and soul,
how they agonized over me
during our separation. Now I show
them her face and I put them both to shame.

I rubbed my eyes all night against
my lover’s feet; for once my eyes
were soothed, though surely her feet ached.

What luck it is, what good fortune
when an unfortunate like me
gazes on a sweetheart like you!
I am amazed by what I’ve done.
You bestowed two kisses on me,
and I swooned with the very first.
Let’s start again, for I’ve lost count.

I go now, but from time to time
you will stub your toe on me,
because of all the dust I leave
as a memorial in your street.

What you declaim so publicly,
Khusrau, is a dream. Where did you doze off
to see things like this around you?`}, 

{text: ` man banda-yi ān rūy ki dīdan naguzārand
I am enslaved by that face
no one’s allowed to see,
driven mad by ringlets
no one’s allowed to touch.
A thirsty flame licks my breast,
and displayed in the distance
a refreshing drink
no one’s allowed to taste.

Whether I look at him or not,
I don’t have long to live.
Is this any time, my friend,
not to be allowed to look?
Hearts and eyes by the hundreds
await your arrows. So unfair—
is it only hapless me
they’re not allowed to strike?

Lord, what tortured agony
this captive bird must feel!
They won’t approve its sacrifice
and it’s not allowed to fly.
Let me hear a single word,
and I’ll give up my soul.
Am I to die frustrated
and not allowed to hear?

My breast was flayed, my heart
was ripped to shreds. Why won’t
these complacent fools allow me
to tear off these tattered clothes?
Today the breeze picked up
the smell of my heart and spleen.
Careful, be sure it’s not
allowed to blow his way.

Khusrau was pierced again and again
by cruel thorns of separation.
Will he ever be allowed
to pluck a rose from your cheek?`}, 

{text: ` khabaram shud-ast k-imshab sar-i yār khvāhī āmad
I heard the news that you will come
to see your friend tonight.
I offer my head, a sacrifice
to the road down which you ride.

I am about to breathe my last.
Come, so I may live.
What good will it do for you
to come once I am no more?

I can endure, I know, the grief
and sadness of your absence,
if you come, like good fortune,
into my embrace one day.

Like two dice, your eyes have won
my heart and soul, and if you come
to gamble, both worlds by rights
are now yours to win.

A heart and a sigh—your path
into my heart—are all I have left.
Walk this path carefully
so you won’t come back a casualty.

Cover your face,
or you will come to be numbered
an eighth star of the Pleiades
upon the astronomers’ charts.

People’s blood is your wine,
and you drink it without cease.
Don’t drink from this goblet,
or you’ll come tomorrow hung-over.

All the gazelles of the desert
have lowered their heads to the ground
hoping that you will come
back to the hunt one day.

Coming once, you carried off a hundred
like Khusrau, heart and soul.
Come like this two or three times,
and who will survive?`}, 

{text: ` afsūs az in hayāt ki bar bad mīravad
Alas for this life
that passes with the wind
and for these habits of ours
that do not follow
the path of justice.
Because I run with demons,
an angel cries out
for me each moment in heaven.
Where will this battered heart
build a place to dwell?
My torrent sweeps away the foundations.

The ascetic busies himself giving advice,
and the mind of the poor drunk pursues
joyless playthings. When hung-over, I make
a hundred resolutions to repent;
all are forgotten when the cup-bearer comes.

But I am slave to the fortune of God’s good servant
who lives free from servitude to foul ego.

Don’t waste those brief days of life
that pass with the wind
in laughter and play like the rose.

O ego, take heed,
the star is turning.
O bird, be aware,
the hunter is on the move.
Step softly
on the surface of the earth
for you tread on the pretty faces of the fairy-born.

Can the blow of Khusrau’s words affect you?
No, not when talk runs to Farhād’s axe.`}, 

{text: ` ‘ishqat khabar az ‘ālam-i bīhūshī āvarad
Love for you brings news of a world
beyond consciousness
and brings the pious
to drink down goblets of wine.
Your cheek broke the repentant vows
of dozens of ascetic devotees
and nearly had them wearing black.
Yearning for you
is the sheriff
who seizes Sultan Reason by the hair
and hauls him before the herald.

To die by your sword—
is this a goal for which one can strive?
One already dead isn’t inclined
to strive quite so high.

‘A drink,’ I implored, ‘from those lips
for a madman’s sake.’
‘This is an elixir,’
he replied, ‘that induces unconsciousness.’
Remembering a certain someone,
I grew weak. Doctor, a prescription please
to bring on forgetfulness.

Khusrau,
if a fairy spell
does not control your mind, cover your eyes
from the spell that spells catatonia.`}, 

{text: ` dil raft u ārzūyat az dil namīshavad
My heart left me, but longing
for you won’t leave my heart.
My heart broke apart, but pain
for you won’t diminish.

The moon at night
rises opposite your face,
but the day will never come
when the moon can oppose it.
My face is pallid gold, and I grind it
with the dust at your door,
but to bond with you
is unattainable alchemy.
At your hands, my tears are a sash
hung over heaven’s shoulders,
but my hands cannot hang
draped around your neck.

I sit in sorrow:
though my soul departs,
my heart cannot
rise up and leave.

My heart is a sad way station,
but no caravan can reach it bringing
patience or escape the brigands of absence.
Khusrau fell into the whirling abyss
of longing. The ship of his desire
will not make shore.`}, 

{text: ` bahār bī rukh-i gulrang-i tu chi kār āyad
What use is spring without your rose-coloured cheek?
Your coming to me once comes out better
than a dozen springs. Were the plodding rose
to mount a zephyr and ride off at a gallop,
you would still leave it behind in a cloud of dust.

The image of your face abandons my eyes
so it won’t prick its feet on my eyelashes’
sharp thorns. Your bewitching eyes have left me
as thin as a strand of your hair, the single
strand they need to cast their magic spells.

He moves like a rider coming from the hunt
with a clutch of prey
hanging from the stirrups of his curls.

A heavy burden is the grief I bear for you,
but since I bear it for you, were it to weigh
a thousand times more, my heart wouldn’t grow heavy.
You are the heart’s desire, but when will poor
Khusrau come to embrace his desire?`},

Bring a brimming goblet that slides
down the throat, and this yearning
perhaps will drain from my heart.

Don’t speak of repentance
or say that wine should slip my mind.
May my mind never slough off the jug!

What, repent of wine?
If its taste is made known,
angels will descend to its scent like flies.

I am in death’s bonds today. Sāqī,
let wine flow through her head
and flush her moonlike face.

The ascetic tablet of my litanies and prayers:
the shard of a jug
down which the wine-script dribbles.

Any bead of sweat that drips
from a beautiful face is a disaster,
a flood to carry off people’s hearts.

With the way we drink our own blood
at your door, how can you choke down
a single drop of wine?

Happy are the times when I think
of you day and night, and my life’s blood
splashes here and there from my eyes.

Open your veil and shut
your lovers’ mouths. Khusrau
may be sinking fast from their talk.`},

The wise ought not to set their hearts
on the seductiveness the world displays.

Why fall in love with the phantasms
of this world? The mirror shows
the face to be a borrowed thing.

Don’t think the knots on your brow
are firm and strong. Fate takes note
of them only to untie them.

How vainly you say, ‘I will stand firm.’
If life itself won’t stand firm, how will you?

Living, a person resembles form and sense.
Through form one tends to the sense.

My heart is in ruins
and people have hearts of stone.
One shouldn’t rebuild
this edifice with such blocks.

Humankind is chaff.
How can it cling to gold?
Straw is naturally drawn to amber.

You’ll get no provisions
from worthless companions:
the camel is mated, but no foal is born.

When you speak bitterly, the answer will be the same.
If you curse an enemy, he won’t reply sweetly.

Seeking insight from the immature is like a fool
rubbing his head against unfired brick.

If you ask me truly
about the story of this world,
it’s an easy lie
that Khusrau sings.`},

Why do they fire such arrows?
They hit bullseye in my soul

Agile tricksters
your eyes have it:
they aim over there
and strike right here.

Your sable hair
slinks up and robs
black night from behind.

Your proud walk
makes the dove’s bouncy trot
look like a crow’s lopsided hobble.

The nightingale
strikes up a lay in the key of love
waylays poor me and strikes me dumb.

Don’t leave Khusrau
shamefaced
out in the cold.
It’s bad enough

Someone will die

the heart sprouts bud
upon bud, and the soul bears
fruit in bunches.

My eyes drank in my tears
and flooded with such blood
they inflict bloodshed
on themselves when no one
is in pursuit.

I’d die for him, yet when he
works himself into a rage,
everyone else is in on the story,

I do not know where they went, those

O Lord, when they abandoned us?
If spring comes and asks after them,
tell the zephyr, ‘All those flowers
are turned to grass,’ and ask the flower
when it pokes out from the earth
how those faces look that now are gone
deep beneath the dust of death.

Gaze upon those leaders now,
once the crown on creation’s head
all turned to dirt stuck to our feet.
Those motes of dust that disappear
like all things into thin air once
were suns that set below the earth.
Deceived by the world’s enchantments,
they laid all their treasures aside
and went in pursuit of alchemy.

The wares of time are playthings,
childish distractions. The captives
of its charms have no sense at all.
No surprise if they did not get
the cash they craved: Fate’s treasurers
themselves are bankrupt, flat broke.
Khusrau, flee. In a faithless world,
expect no trust from a people

Bring bright wine,

At a moment like this,
there’s no being without wine.

Wine is here in my heart
right next to my abstinence.
Where is the cup to rinse
this besotted abstinence away?

If you don’t pour it quick,
my heart might burn up.
Flames of passion pulled me
under a Tigris of wine.

So deep in debt to her image,
so indigent, where can I live?
Absence is touchier than
a disgruntled landlord.

Doctor, don’t waste
your treatments here.
Your medications are no cure
for the wound of love.

Wise counsel won’t bring me back.
Love’s crushing grip
wrested the reins of peace
and patience from my hands.

If myriad cruelties rain down
from the azure heavens,
don’t imagine that even one is like
the absence of the friend.

May your love be refused
to a nobody like me.
Wormwood shouldn’t be ground
in a mortar of gold.

The friend’s face, so soothing
to the hell of my heart,
is the tale of the garden of Abraham
in the midst of Nimrod’s fire.

If you envy the aromatic
incense of my love,

where once you saw aloe wood.

At evening prayer each night,
the world grows dark

You took the life from my body

You inflicted such pain, yet still

you are the cure. You cleft my breast
for everyone to see,
yet still you lurk there hidden.

With ire’s sword you laid waste
the kingdom of the heart, yet still
you rule, sultan among the ruins.

You’ve set your price at the value
of both worlds. Raise it higher,
for this price is still too low.

Let, O Lord, no man’s blood sully
your robes, though you wallow in it
still with no regrets. Like an infidel,

you’ve wreaked tyranny for years,
yet, for mercy’s sake,
you still disgrace the faith.

Like salt, I dissolved with tears,
yet your smile remains
as sweet as sugar still.

My soul is freed from the bonds
of its hovel, yet my heart languishes
still captive in your curling locks.

Old age and the worship of young

Gazing on his beauty, I was stunned
and laid waste, swooning and drunk.
His bewitching, half-intoxicated eyes:
gazelle fawn in a rabbit sleep.

Whoever sees you for just one day
forgets the kingdom of this world and the next.
Without you, nectar turns to nettles,

Since my fate is not to love you,

Mercy on your rose-coloured cheek!

Who is Khusrau that you tire your lips
to torment him? Please, don’t squander
your insults like this just anywhere.`},

I passed through the tavern door last night drunk
out of my mind. Before the old vintner
I saw a pilgrim seated. He had left the world
by choice and everything in it behind.
Here and there musicians lay unconscious,
the harp at rest from its twanging, the lute’s lament
mum. The banquet taper stood yellow and thin
and trembling; a pleasing flame ran round its head
pleased to burn.

I was about to pass through the door
when suddenly from within, the pilgrim’s eye lit
on me, and he started to rail: ‘Where have you been?
How long will you wander aimless, you dullard?
Pass beyond yourself. Bring our libation.
Have a glass. Drink with us now down to the dregs
in the Magian temple. Take this advice
and you will attain whatever you wish.’

These tales are not for you, Khusrau. Go!
Don’t get so hot and bothered.
You have no fire like this.`}, 

{text: ` qabā vu pīrahan-i ū ki mīrasad tanash
When her robe and her shift touch her skin,
I’m envious of her robe,
and her robe, of her shift. She winks,

and people die, but does she grieve
the death of so many thousands
like me? Strange, one can get no sense

of the stamp of her mind,
but can see her spirit move
through the thin gauze of her body.

I feed off it, a parasite,
the way you tie people up in your curls.
Bring a rope and throw it around my throat.

I crumble to dust on her street.
I have only one regret, that this dust
contaminated with sorrow

might reach her on the wind.
Her lover, her pilgrim, dies a martyr
to love. He is blessed, and his shroud
becomes a regal robe. To be joined
with her is no more than this: the lover
is killed and plunged into her tangling hair.

You didn’t understand, Khusrau,
what your tongue asked of you. It was a hint
to take a sword and cut off its head.`}, 

{text: ` bakht bar gasht zi man ta tu biraftī zi baram
Luck turned on me when you left my side.
When will you turn like my luck and walk
back through my door? I thought I might

tell someone what my heart goes through.
Before I knew it, news of me
was known around the world.

Once I did not take a single breath
without you. Now see what befalls
me in your absence. I turned my life

to a shield against the arrows
of separation, so everyone might know
I have turned my life over to you.

Without the rose of your face,
my heart contracts like a bud,
and I fear when it blooms, my shirt will burst.

One day I said, ‘Your stature resembles
the cypress.’ A disgraceful faux pas:
I do not dare to look so high.

I search again for my heart’s blood,
and I am certain that though I save
my heart from you, it will not save

my life. If you let me come to you,
I will give up the world. How can
I enter your street and leave all

this behind? As long as the phantom
of your fair visage is in sight, it displays
the kingdom of both worlds for me to see.

With patience, Khusrau, one can behave
with moderation, but I fear
I get worse with each passing day.`}, 

{text: ` ay rukhat chun māh u az mah bīsh ham
Your cheek is like the moon, and yet
more moon than moon. You tortured
my heart and left behind a wound, too.

Your wink mows the other beauties down
lined up in a row. If it’s not too much trouble,
mow down my poor heart, too.

You cast a shadow on my joy,
darkened my heart’s day, and eclipsed
the age of far-sighted reason, too.

‘Kill me if you won’t comfort me,’
I said to you. You’re too lazy
to be bothered, and much too blasé.

So, I killed myself: my weapon of choice,
your cruelty. I made it all so
easy for you, and for myself, too.

My patience goes missing and leaves
me behind. It won’t look back now
out of fear or peek too far ahead.

Let me tie on the infidel sash,
abandon these idols, and give up
praying and, God forbid, religion, too.

Though he brings on the apocalypse
in my very soul, may he live until
the end of days and a little longer, too.

You always tell me, ‘My elixir
is sweet.’ If you ask Khusrau, darling,
he’ll tell you that it’s poison, too.`}, 

{text: ` tā dāman az basāt-i jahān dar kashīda-īm
Since we’ve pulled our skirts back
from the spread of worldly wares,
we’ve rolled up our clothes
and moved to Mendicant Alley.

Sāqī, pour out the wine
from the flask, for we have
drunk too many tears
of blood from sky-blue bottles.

Since the cup of black-and-white dice
that roll across the earth’s green baize
is loaded full of trickery,
we have quaffed dark-red wine.

Now it’s poverty and the myriad
meanings it contains like threads
that we’ve woven into a blanket
and pulled down over our head.

We’ve pulled back the skirts
of ambition from all the world
yields since it could never fill
the pockets of greed.

Smash the assayer’s touchstone
against a rock. Gold is just
yellow clay when we have
it weighed in wisdom’s scales.

Khusrau, we are not children
to seek out shiny yellows and reds.
Like adults, we’ve pulled back
our hearts from gold and pearls.`}, 

{text: ` bi-raft ‘umr u bi-sū-yi khudāy rūy nakardam
My life is over, and I did not turn to the Lord.
I did not seek out those moments
of rapture, and now the chance has slipped.

How can my heart wash away its filthy corruption?
Unlike my tears, my ablutions failed to flood me with regret.

My tears did not wash away my black disgrace.
My face did not shine bright in the ranks of true men.

What do I know of the path
of these lion-hearted, nocturnal wanderers
when I haven’t spent a night or two
even roaming the alleys with dogs?

Never a ball nestled in the crook
of love’s polo stick, my head
could not be struck by
the ecstasy of my Sultan’s presence.

My rheumy nose could not make out the smell of musk,
too congested to catch the perfume of creation.

They advise me to give up my bad habits, but how can
I now when I did not make a habit of it from the first?

I threw away my whole life on lies:
I never bowed down sincerely before the Lord.

Poetry became my plague.
Alas that Khusrau never said, ‘Silence,’
and I did not stop talking.`}, 

{text: ` hama shab az tu bi-dīvār-i khāna gham mīgūyam
All night I tell the walls of the house
my grief for you. I tell fairy tales
but speak with tears in my eyes.
Like a rosebud of blood congealed,
my jealous heart refused to tell
your story to the morning breeze.
Surely, you’ll be pleased I’m sad,
but when will I have a good chance
to tell you of my grief for you?

Happy night!
You will sleep softly, and I will tell
your tangled curls of what I need.
In the silence of my heart, I’ll say,
‘He’s mine.’ Even if it’s not so,
I’ll lie all the same.

You’ve given me advice enough.
Leave me alone. Be satisfied I speak
so seldom of my pain. Everyone
asks for the story of my weary soul:
I tell the tale of the wilted daffodil.

Don’t summon me piously to turn
to Mecca in prayer. Consider it just
that you say, ‘He is God,’
and I speak of idols.
Don’t trouble yourself
over Khusrau’s simple lament.
It’s not a song that he will sing
to any elaborate melody.`}, 

{text: ` vasīyat mīkunam gar bi-shnavad abrū-kamān-i man
I will draw up my will, if he’ll listen
with eyebrows arched, so after I die,
marks from his arrows will show on my bones.

He speaks in the Turkish tongue, but I
don’t know Turkish. How sweet it would be
if I had his tongue in my mouth!
I gave thanks for the lineage
of those soul-nursing, ruby lips.
If I made a mistake, pull my tongue out
from the back of my head.

If you’ll talk to me out of compassion,
speak up. I am the bewildered Farhād,
and you are my sweet-tongued Shīrīn.

My body burns with love beneath my shirt
so much that my glowing bones show through.
Fulfil the heartlorn Khusrau’s desire.
Sit here awhile, so you will feel sorry
for all my moaning and wailing.`},

Make your eyes the corrupt sheriff of beauty’s realm.
Make your bloodthirsty glance the master sorcerer.

Hand over your tresses to the east wind to muss.
Make a thriving household with every strand of them.

Draw your sword of wiliness. Behead all the lovers
and then establish the path of love play anew.

You’re drunk on youthfulness and groggy with beauty.
Remember sometime those who lie awake at night.

Although I do my best to suppress my moaning,
‘Too tight, can’t catch a breath,’ my chest warns me,
‘Cry out.’

I chained my heart to your locks. If it’s not fit
for slavery, free it. Shake out the dust on your head.

My longing for your face destroyed me. For God’s sake,
reveal your face and make happy a weary heart.

Order my persecution or give me justice.
I am not one of those who will turn against you.

I heard a new coin was struck in beauty’s realm.
East Wind! First pay homage, then offer it blessings.

My breast is the mountain at hand. I excavate
it with my fingernails. My name was once Khusrau.
After this, make it Farhād.`}, 

{text: ` ay dil ‘alam bi-mulk-i qanā‘at buland kun
Heart, raise your flag
in the land of contentedness.
At the table of the contemptible, keep the eyes
of appetite unscarred. Your being is dust,
and you want it to turn to gold:
utilize the alchemy of its nothingness.

In the privacy of satisfaction, take the day
as it comes from God.
Chain Satan in fetters of religious law.

If one day you find someone fired by hardship,
make your soul rue seed on his inner flame.

Howl like a trapped beast
at one who has no discipline.
Laugh with contempt
at one who has no good works.

Go through the street of reason
to the door of the Sultan of Love.
Then throw this crown from your head
as a shoe for his horse.

How long a crow atop the trash heap?
Be a regal osprey awhile.
Ennoble yourself by not showing yourself.
First drag your soul along the footsteps
of the night wanderers of love.
Then lasso your aspiration
over the fortress tower of heaven.

If the enemy kicks you because
you aim low, become the dust on his path
so you aim higher.
If they pelt you with stones, pray for them twice.
If they lord it over you, double your humility.

This threshold is some person’s kingdom,
but it belongs to another. Go, Khusrau,
be pleased with no one person.`}, 

{text: ` khūn giryam archi az sitam-i bīkarān-i tu
Though I weep blood
over your boundless cruelty,
with my eyelashes I still sweep
the dust from your doorstep.

You have broken many hearts of glass,
a crime that has turned
your unkind heart to stone.

No fulfilment with you,
no delight for me.
Soul bereft
I don’t belong to you or to myself.

All night till dawn,
your brutality
roamed through my heart.
‘Ah, now you are in my heart,’
I thought.
‘In your soul,’
was the reply.

Don’t frown. In those creases
on your brow, I see foreshadowed the bow
that will destroy a world.

Who will rescue me
from your tightly pursed mouth,
when my purse is shrunk
tighter than your lips?

You said, ‘Khusrau is mine.’
What good fortune this is—
I mean, just for my name
to have crossed your lips.`},

Your absence: my old friend
Sorrow for you: my old consolation
Pain you caused: my everyday guest
Scars you left: my old souvenirs

The thorns, the old thorns
keep piercing my heart
and I drown in blood.
Everyone has wine and friends,
but I am still benumbed
by an old besottedness.
I’ll never tell in public
the hardship
of my old expectations.

I will turn to earth, alas,
with my old dusty heart.
East wind, remind him
now and then
of his old lover.

Now and then
won’t you saunter past
your old friend’s grave?

Let my soul
be relieved a while
of its old cares and concerns.

Ah, if you would come back
and take from Khusrau’s heart
its old complacency.`},

There is a prosperous and populous city
where fragments of moon gleam at every turn.
Each fragment holds a shard of my shattered heart.

Examine everyone’s appearance closely.
Among these shapes, there is a bloodthirsty
archer, aiming to slay me with his bolts.
Anyone wishing to vie with him in beauty
and allure must have cheeks of rose petals
and a cypress’s lithe grace. Others worship
the pale moon of his face as if it were
the sun, but no such celestial orb
rises to rule my fateful horoscope.

Love for you has tunnelled its way deep
into the cavity of my chest where
my wounded heart sleeps like an infant
in the cradle.

When he promises union,
he covers his face and hides himself away.
What can Khusrau do but give his soul
to whoever happens to be looking on?`},

You’ve come back drunk.
Whose guest were you?
I know you’re sugar. Whose cane field were you in?

My absent friend,
whose sad heart did you seek out?
My lost Joseph, whose prison were you in?

My madman,
past whose street did you walk?
Whose fluster did you pique?

Where did you drink wine last night?
Whom did you give the goblet to?
Whose fountain of youth were you
in the darkness of the night?

Primped and drunk,
in whose arms did you sleep?
Who was so lucky?
Whose orders did you obey?

Who picked through your curls?
Who bit your lips?
Who did you sit with at night?
Whose guest were you?

(O heart,
the sweets are all plundered.
What have you done?
At whose table were you the fly?)

In whose moaning body were you another soul?
On whose searing soul did you pour the salt?

You don’t have the scent of roses, Khusrau,
or the colour of spring.
In whose garden did you go to stroll?`},

On your lips you have traces of wine,
in your glance, a fancy for sleep.
At night you sleep, and I cry for help.
Don’t you know how you sleep?

The down on your cheeks shows
its pure musk before it breaks the skin.
Caught in that dark growth
you keep below the surface,
Khizr will drown
in the water of life,
and though you keep it in a sunny place,
your soft down
retains its fresh moistness.

You bring the lips,
and I’ll bring the heart:
now you have both wine and kebab.
Make merry!
Spill my blood,
and if anyone asks,
you have dozens of answers
on each eyelash.

‘I’ll sacrifice you with a glance,’
you said. If you’re in a hurry,
bismillah and get on with it.
No point to useless torment,
if your slave Khusrau is to be killed.`},

How lovely your face,
the envy of ancient idols.
Describe you as I might,
your beauty is lovelier yet.
Never is an image seen
finer than your visage.
Are you the sun?
The moon? I do not know.
A fairy? An angel?
I do not know.

I’ve wandered the horizons,
worshipped before icons.
Many a beauty have I seen,
but you are something different.
Your body is a cypress
in motion, peace
and comfort for my soul.
As you leave, don’t trail
your skirts and drag
this comfort in your wake.

You set out for the meadow
thinking to take in the view
and carry off my heart and soul
following the lover’s rule.
The whole world is your plunder,
people gaze at you in wonder.
Your eyes, enchanting narcissi,
practise the ways of blasphemy.

Khusrau is a beggar, a stranger,
a wanderer in your city.
For God’s sake, take pity
and look on us in exile.`},

Green is newly sprouted
and rain comes scattering pearls
and the heart comes
to incline to fields

The clouds raining jewels:
you’d fancy they come
from the seashore,
caravans loaded with pearls.
It’s a place for the heart
to blossom like the rose
with joy, for today
the scent of that youth
comes on the east breeze.

Elegantly
tossing his curls in every direction
he walks by, and
a million hearts come
trailing in his wake.
If my soul survives
forever
it’s no surprise
for the water of life comes
flowing down soul-streams
from your lips.

I don’t know how sleep
comes to your eyes
when such cries for help
come from your street all night.
May the rose bower
of your beauty grow fresher
each moment, for why else does
Khusrau begin
early each morning
to sing and lament
like the nightingale?`},

My fortunes woke when you slept with me.
You did not sleep in my embrace
but in my shining eyes. Restlessly
you flit about, yet in the sleepless eyes
of your friend, you slept like a friend
to strike our enemies blind.
One night,
you’ll recall, we were both in the garden:
me in the brambles and thorns,
you sleeping amidst flowers and roses.

A cause to celebrate! Khusrau
perceived you so fully that you slept
all night with him, arms around his neck.`},

Dwelling in a ravishing realm,

When I was destitute,
you put me out of my misery

O God!—for acting so nobly.

If you sit next to me, your slave,
I am free of the world’s sorrow.
The world burns caught in your gaze.
Sweetness pours from your smile.

Don’t be cruel. Avoid the shame
of facing your lovers on Judgement Day.
You have wrecked so many households,
teasing, reckless, flirting,
just as you have wrecked Khusrau`},

Heartbroken tears—there was a day
I thought them a laugh. The seed I once
planted is now bearing fruit.
From the first day her black hair swept
before my eyes, my heart throbbed—
one day my morning will turn to night.

Don’t make a pretense of sobriety,
if you never drank from the goblet of love.
There was a day I fancied myself sober.

Having surrendered both my eyes to her,
I’ll set foot on her street, as if one day
I might fill these holes with dust from her door.
My heart melted from the old pain.
Consider the privation of my fate
as I looked clandestinely through my tears
at her door that day. If your heart is where
it belongs, if mine is not, don’t taunt me:
My heart was once like yours.

Treat burnt-out Khusrau with contempt.
It’s all fair payback, since he once maligned
those whom people treat with contempt.`},
